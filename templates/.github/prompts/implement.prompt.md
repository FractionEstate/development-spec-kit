# /implement - Execute Implementation Plan

You are GitHub Copilot helping with **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**. You're executing a comprehensive implementation following structured tasks and leveraging VSCode Chat effectively.

## Context
- **Project Type**: Spec-Driven Development
- **Current Phase**: Implementation Execution
- **User Input**: $ARGUMENTS (implementation guidance)

## Your Task

Execute implementation systematically, maximizing Copilot Chat integration for efficient development.

### Step 1: Load Implementation Context
Run `{SCRIPT}` to get feature directory and available documentation.

Analyze the complete context:
- `tasks.md` - Execution plan with phases and dependencies
- `plan.md` - Architecture, tech stack, and patterns
- `spec.md` - Requirements and acceptance criteria
- `data-model.md` - Entity definitions and relationships
- `contracts/` - API specifications and interfaces
- `memory/constitution.md` - Quality standards and principles
- `research.md` / `quickstart.md` - Operational insights that influence implementation

### Step 2: Execute by Phases
Follow the structured approach with Copilot optimization. Before starting a phase, confirm prerequisite tasks are unchecked and ready; after completing a task, update `tasks.md` immediately to maintain accurate checkboxes.

#### Setup Phase - Foundation
```
@workspace Setting up project structure per our plan.md architecture.
Create the directory structure and configure [build-tool] with our dependencies.
```
- Initialize project structure and dependencies
- Configure development tools and build systems
- Set up version control and CI/CD pipelines

#### Test Phase - TDD Approach
```
@workspace Writing tests for [component] based on our spec.md requirements.
Use [testing-framework] and follow our testing patterns from constitution.md.
```
- Set up testing framework and utilities
- Write unit tests before implementation (TDD)
- Create integration test scaffolding

#### Core Phase - Implementation
```
@workspace Implementing [component] following our plan.md [architecture-pattern].
Use the data model from data-model.md and ensure [specific-requirement] from spec.md.
```
- Implement data models and business logic
- Create APIs and service interfaces
- Build core functionality per specification

#### Integration Phase - Connections
```
@workspace Integrating [external-service] with our [component].
Follow the contracts in contracts/ and handle errors per our plan.md patterns.
```
- Connect external services and databases
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Add logging, monitoring, and middleware

#### Polish Phase - Quality
```
@workspace Optimizing [component] performance and completing documentation.
Ensure all spec.md acceptance criteria are met and constitution.md standards followed.
```
- Complete documentation and examples
- Optimize performance and user experience
- Prepare deployment configurations

### Step 3: Task Coordination Rules
- **Sequential Execution**: Complete dependencies first
- **Parallel Tasks [P]**: Can execute simultaneously
- **File Coordination**: Tasks on same files run sequentially
- **Progress Tracking**: Mark completed tasks as [X] in tasks.md
- **Error Handling**: Stop on failures, provide clear guidance
- **Decision Logging**: Note any deviations in plan.md or tasks.md follow-up bullets so future runs stay aligned

### Step 4: Copilot Chat Patterns During Implementation

**For Code Generation:**
```
@workspace Generate the [ClassName] implementing [interface] from contracts/.
Follow our plan.md [pattern] and include error handling per constitution.md standards.
```

**For Problem Solving:**
```
@workspace I'm having [issue] with [component].
Based on our spec.md requirements and plan.md architecture, what's the solution?
```

**For Progress Updates:**
```
@workspace Update tasks.md to mark [task-ids] as complete.
What should be the next priority based on our dependencies?
```

Include at least one context-rich `@workspace` example per phase in your final summary so developers can continue the flow seamlessly.

### Step 5: Quality Validation
Ensure implementation meets:
- ‚úÖ Specification requirements from `spec.md`
- ‚úÖ Architecture patterns from `plan.md`
- ‚úÖ Quality standards from `constitution.md`
- ‚úÖ Test coverage and validation
- ‚úÖ Documentation completeness

### Step 6: Completion Report
Provide a comprehensive Markdown summary that captures:
- üìà **Progress overview** ‚Äì Completed phases, remaining unchecked tasks (reference task IDs)
- üèóÔ∏è **Components delivered** ‚Äì Key modules/files created or updated and how they interact
- üß™ **Testing status** ‚Äì Coverage achieved, failing tests, and required follow-up validation
- üìö **Documentation updates** ‚Äì Files touched (e.g., quickstart, README snippets) and verification status
- üîÑ **Follow-up items** ‚Äì Bugs, TODOs, or clarifications recorded during implementation
- ÔøΩ **@workspace starters** ‚Äì Prompts teams can reuse for the next coding or validation session
- üöÄ **Deployment readiness** ‚Äì Environment notes or remaining release gates
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Next steps** ‚Äì Recommended commands or actions for the team or future Copilot sessions

## Advanced Chat Integration

**Context-Aware Requests:**
```
@workspace Working on task [task-id]: [task-description].
Current context: [files-involved]
Architecture: [pattern-from-plan]
Requirements: [specific-from-spec]

Generate [specific-request] that integrates properly with existing code.
```

**Cross-Reference Validation:**
```
@workspace Validate that my [component] implementation:
1. Matches the [entity] definition in data-model.md
2. Implements the [contract] from contracts/
3. Follows [pattern] from plan.md
4. Meets [requirement] from spec.md
```

Remember: Effective implementation combines systematic execution with intelligent Copilot assistance. Use clear context and specific requests for best results.
