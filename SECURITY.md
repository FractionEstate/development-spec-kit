Thanks for helping keep the Spec Kit ecosystem safe for everyone.

# Security

FractionEstate maintains this project and takes the security of our users, contributors, and downstream adopters seriously. Spec Kit is optimized for GitHub Models and GitHub Copilot workflows, so we rely on GitHub's coordinated disclosure program to receive and triage reported vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately so we can investigate and ship a fix before details become public.

**Do not open public issues, discussions, or pull requests for suspected vulnerabilities.**

Instead, choose one of the following coordinated disclosure channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** – Use the "Report a vulnerability" link in the GitHub UI for this repository. This creates a private advisory thread with the maintainers.
- **Email** – Send a message to opensource-security[@]github.com with "FractionEstate Spec Kit" in the subject line.

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess impact:

- Vulnerability category (e.g., command injection, insecure deserialization)
- Affected file paths and relevant snippets or commit hashes
- Required configuration, environment variables, or external dependencies
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Proof-of-concept exploit or expected vs. actual behavior
- Potential impact and severity assessment if known

We will acknowledge receipt within five business days, coordinate on remediation timelines, and notify you when a fix is available. With your permission, we'll credit your report in the release notes once the issue is resolved.

## Policy

All coordinated disclosure follows [GitHub's Safe Harbor Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/security-policies/github-bug-bounty-program-legal-safe-harbor#1-safe-harbor-terms). At this time, the Spec Kit project is outside the scope of GitHub's public bug bounty rewards program, but security reports remain highly appreciated.
