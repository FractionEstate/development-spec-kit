# FractionEstate Development Spec Kit

GitHub Models + VS Code, purpose-built for Spec‑Driven Development.

## Start here

- Quickstart (60‑second start): [quickstart.md](quickstart.md)
- Installation (one‑liners + options): [installation.md](installation.md)
- Local development (hack on the CLI): [local-development.md](local-development.md)
- Methodology (why and how SDD): [../spec-driven.md](../spec-driven.md)

## What this kit includes

- `specify` CLI to initialize a GitHub Models–optimized workspace
- Curated Copilot Chat guidance under `.github/` (instructions, context, prompts)
- VS Code tasks/snippets wired for SDD flows
- Spec templates and a starter constitution

## GitHub Models–first

Only GitHub Models are supported. The CLI fetches models (or uses a curated fallback) and injects your choice into the prompts and workspace configuration.
